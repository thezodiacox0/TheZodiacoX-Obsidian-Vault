# TheZodiacoX Obsidian Vault v1.0.0
## A Template for my Obsidian Vault.

This is a copy of my Obsidian Vault that you can use as a template or inspiration for your own vault.

This vault contains several of [CyanVoxel](https://github.com/CyanVoxel/) other snippets, which you can find in their own (and updated) repositories here:
- [Colored Sidebar](https://github.com/CyanVoxel/Obsidian-Colored-Sidebar)
- [Daily Themes](https://github.com/CyanVoxel/Obsidian-Daily-Themes)
- [Notebook Themes](https://github.com/CyanVoxel/Obsidian-Notebook-Themes)
- [Game Themes](https://github.com/CyanVoxel/Obsidian-Game-Themes)

This Obsidian Vault is based on the original released by [CyanVoxel](https://github.com/CyanVoxel/) which I want to give credit for be its original creator.
